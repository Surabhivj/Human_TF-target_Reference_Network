# Human_TF-target_Reference_Network

This Jupyter notebook collects Protein-Protein (PPI), Transcription Factor(TF)-Target interactions for Human from different data sources with their latest update.

We build here, the Human reference network of TF-targets and PPIs that can be used as a gold-standard network to compare the performace of Gene Regulatory Network (GRN)  and PPI inference methods repectively.
